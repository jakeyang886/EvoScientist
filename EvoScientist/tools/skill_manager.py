    """Manage user-installable skills: install from GitHub or local path, list available skills, get details, or uninstall.

    Actions and required parameters:

    action="install" (requires source):
      Install a skill. The source can be:
      - GitHub shorthand: "owner/repo@skill-name" (e.g. "anthropics/skills@peft")
      - GitHub URL: "https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/skill-name"
      - Local path: "./my-skill" or "/path/to/skill"
      Nested skills are auto-resolved — if the skill is not at the repo root, subdirectories are searched automatically.

    action="list":
      List installed skills. By default only shows user-installed skills.
      Set include_system=True to also show built-in system skills (peft, accelerate, flash-attention, etc.).

    action="info" (requires name):
      Get details (description, source, path) about a specific skill by name.
      Searches both user and system skills.

    action="uninstall" (requires name):
      Remove a user-installed skill by name. System skills cannot be uninstalled.

    Args:
        action: The operation to perform — "install", "list", "info", or "uninstall"
        source: Required for install — GitHub shorthand, GitHub URL, or local directory path
        name: Required for info and uninstall — the skill name (e.g. "peft", "my-custom-skill")
        include_system: Only for list — set True to include built-in system skills in the output

    Returns:
